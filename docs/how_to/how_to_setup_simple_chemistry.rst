How to setup simple chemistry
-----------------------------

In ProteusLib, chemistry modules leverage the Generic Properties
(https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/components/property_package/general/index.html#generic-property-package-framework)
and Generic Reactions
(https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/components/property_package/general_reactions/index.html)
objects in IDAES. These objects can be used in conjunction with any unit process
where chemical reactions need to be considered. In this guide, we will cover how
to use these built-in objects within your own unit process.
